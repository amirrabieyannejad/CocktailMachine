  abstract      = {Development of a tumor is known to be a result of accumulation of DNA changes in somatic cells. However, the processes of how DNA changes are produced and how they accumulate in somatic cells are not clear. DNA changes include two types: point DNA mutations and chromosome changes. However, point DNA mutations (DNA mutations) are the main type of DNA changes that can remain and accumulate in cells. Severe DNA injuries are the causes for DNA mutations. However, Misrepair of DNA is an essential process for transforming a DNA injury into a survivable and inheritable DNA mutation. In somatic cells, Misrepair of DNA is the main source of DNA mutations. Since the surviving chance of a cell by Misrepair of DNA is low, accumulation of DNA mutations can take place only possibly in the cells that can proliferate. Tumors can only develop in the tissues that are regenerable. The accumulation of Misrepairs of DNA needs to proceed in many generations of cells, and cell transformation from a normal cell into a tumor cell is a slow and long process. However, once a cell is transformed especially when it is malignantly transformed, the deficiency of DNA repair and the rapid cell proliferation will accelerate the accumulation of DNA mutations. The process of accumulation of DNA mutations is actually the process of aging of a genome DNA. Repeated cell injuries and repeated cell regenerations are the two preconditions for tumor-development. For cancer prevention, a moderate and flexible living style is advised.},

Motivation DNA has been reported as a promising medium of data storage for its remarkable durability and space-efficient storage capacity. Here, we propose a robust DNA-based data storage method based on a new codec algorithm, namely ‘Yin-Yang’. Results Using this strategy, we successfully stored different formats of files in one synthetic DNA oligonucleotide pool. Compared to most DNA-based data storage coding schemes presented to date, this codec system can efficiently achieve a variety of user goals (e.g. reduce homopolymer length to 3 or 4 at most, maintain balanced GC content between 40\% and 60\% and simple secondary structure with the Gibbs free energy above −30 kcal/mol). We tested this codec by an end-to-end experiment including encoding, DNA synthesis, sequencing and decoding. We demonstrate successful retrieval of 2.02 Megabits /3 files using this method. The original information was fully retrieved after sequencing and decoding. Compared to the previously reported methods, our strategy exhibits great potential at achieving high storing capacity per nucleotide (230 PB/gram) and high fidelity of data recovery.},

Our study is motivated by this example. In this paper we classify all poset structures which admit the extended binary Hamming code to be a double or triple-error-correcting perfect P-code.},

  abstract  = {die Kanalcodierung zur Fehlererkennung und -korrektur ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil in modernen digitalen Kommunikations- und Speichersystemen wie etwa CD und DVD, Internet-Datenübertragung, Mobilfunk, Satellitenkommunikation und digitales Fernsehen. Das Buch gibt eine grundlegende Einführung in die Codierungstheorie. Alle derzeit bekannten Decodierverfahren werden beschrieben und eingeordnet. Durch die übersichtliche und geschlossene Darstellung eignet sich das Werk gut zum vorlesungsbegleitenden Studium. Übungsaufgaben helfen, das vermittelte Wissen zu vertiefen.},
