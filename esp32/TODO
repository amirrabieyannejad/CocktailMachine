notifications ok?

tare_scale is used in weird places, think it over

transition states
	- calibration
		# - implement stages (like with recipe)
		# - test
		# - check for race conditions / clean up transitions
		# - reduce noisiness of the debug
		- test with real hardware
		- document process

	- recipe making
		# - check the test log that it's ok
		# - check that error_state is handled right
		- document the new process
